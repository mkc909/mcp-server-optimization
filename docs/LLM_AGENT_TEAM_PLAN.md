# LLM Agent Team Implementation Plan for Cross-System Communication MCP Server

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for developing the Cross-System Agent Communication MCP Server using a team of LLM agents (different Roo modes/roles). As SysAdmin mode, I will lead this project and coordinate with other LLM agent roles to complete the implementation.

## LLM Agent Team Structure

Our team will consist of the following LLM agent roles/modes:

### Core Team

1. **SysAdmin Mode (Project Lead)**
   - Overall project coordination and oversight
   - Infrastructure and deployment management
   - Integration with existing systems
   - Resource monitoring and optimization
   - Documentation and reporting

2. **Code Mode**
   - Core MCP server implementation
   - GitHub integration components
   - API endpoints and message bus development
   - Unit and integration testing
   - Code documentation

3. **Architect Mode**
   - System architecture design
   - Database schema design
   - API design and specification
   - Security architecture
   - Performance optimization strategies

4. **Debug Mode**
   - Testing and validation
   - Error handling and debugging
   - Performance profiling
   - Issue resolution
   - Quality assurance

## Cross-System Collaboration

The Cross-System Agent Communication MCP Server itself will enable these LLM agent roles to communicate and collaborate across different systems. During development, we will use GitHub as our central coordination mechanism:

1. **GitHub Issues**
   - Track tasks and progress
   - Document requirements and specifications
   - Record decisions and rationale

2. **GitHub Pull Requests**
   - Review and approve code changes
   - Document implementation details
   - Ensure quality and consistency

3. **GitHub Discussions**
   - Discuss design decisions
   - Resolve technical questions
   - Share knowledge and insights

## Implementation Phases

The implementation will follow the four phases outlined in the detailed implementation plan, with different LLM agent roles taking the lead in different phases:

### Phase 1: Core MCP Server Development (Weeks 1-2)

**Lead: Code Mode with Architect Mode support**

- Repository setup and project scaffolding
- Agent registry implementation
- Basic message bus implementation
- Task management system
- Context sharing mechanism

### Phase 2: GitHub Integration (Weeks 3-4)

**Lead: Code Mode with SysAdmin Mode support**

- GitHub API integration
- Issue and PR management
- Project board integration
- Comment system for agent interaction

### Phase 3: PlanetScale Integration (Weeks 5-6)

**Lead: Architect Mode with Code Mode support**

- Database setup and schema implementation
- Migration system implementation
- Query optimization and connection pooling
- Data backup and recovery procedures

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing (Weeks 7-8)

**Lead: Debug Mode with SysAdmin Mode support**

- Component integration
- Error handling and logging
- Security review
- Testing and deployment

## Workflow Between LLM Agent Roles

### Task Assignment Process

1. **SysAdmin Mode** creates GitHub issues for tasks based on the implementation plan
2. **Architect Mode** reviews and refines technical specifications
3. **Code Mode** implements the functionality
4. **Debug Mode** tests and validates the implementation
5. **SysAdmin Mode** approves and integrates the changes

### Communication Between LLM Agent Roles

LLM agent roles will communicate through:

1. **GitHub Issues and Pull Requests**
   - Formal task assignments and reviews
   - Technical discussions and decisions

2. **Cross-System Agent Communication MCP Server** (once operational)
   - Real-time communication between agent roles
   - Context sharing and task coordination

3. **Shared Documentation**
   - Implementation plans and specifications
   - Progress reports and status updates

## Role Switching Strategy

Since we are working with a single LLM system that can adopt different roles/modes, we will use a structured approach to role switching:

1. **Explicit Role Definition**
   - Clearly define which role is active at any given time
   - Document the purpose and scope of each role switch

2. **Context Preservation**
   - Maintain context across role switches
   - Document decisions and rationale for future reference

3. **Handoff Documentation**
   - Create clear handoff notes when switching roles
   - Specify next steps and expectations
